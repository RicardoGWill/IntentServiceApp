# IntentServiceApp
This app ("IntentService App") is a more advanced yet simpler version of "Started Service App".  This app does not require me to make my own thread.  Rather, it makes its own thread when needed.  This is extremely useful for multitasking, as the Service will not interfere with the Main Activity.
